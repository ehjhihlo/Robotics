# CSIE5047 Robotics: Chinese Poker Self-Playing Robot
We propose a robotic system "Chinese Poker Self-Playing Robot". Controlled by TM-5 robot arm, the robot can suck the cards from the card stack and put them on the card rack, then take a photo to get card information to decide which card to play.

## Execution
One can execute the system by running the following command:
```
python3 image_sub_new.py
python3 send_script.py
```
